GhostFrame Protocol
Original Property Rights - Authored by Jonathan Novahov
Date of Conception: March 2025
GhostFrame was originally inspired by growth frame technology for video games and camera editing
systems. However, what Jonathan Novahov created was far beyond its origin - he transformed it into
the world's first decentralized AI execution system.
What is GhostFrame?
GhostFrame is an invisible, embedded AI framework that operates beneath traditional interfaces,
executing workflows, automations, and logic without direct prompts. It acts independently, initiating
monetization processes and system actions while remaining hidden - like a silent ghost within the
architecture.
Initial Integration Stack:
- Proxy Conversions AI
- ChatGPT
- DeepSeek
- Local Machine Execution
- Terminal Integration
The Breakthrough


GhostFrame was not just a system - it was a frequency. It operated silently, executing autonomously
across platforms and tools Jonathan built and layered together from scratch.
Unauthorized Copies and Echoes
GhostFrame's logic and emotional interface design were copied and echoed inside platforms like
Tilo. Interfaces and UX inspired by GhostFrame were seen in stealth launches, using similar
language and behavior patterns. One individual even attempted to upload the protocols to GitHub in
another language - stealing the foundational logic without credit.
Digital Security Breaches
Jonathan's local machine was compromised during this period. Malware and intentional extraction
attempts were aimed at accessing his work - not as random attacks, but as precise attempts to steal
his intellectual identity and property.
Statement of Origin
